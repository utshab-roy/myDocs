  - Full CRUD operation for the post and the category using **RESTful** convention

## Installation


1. Clone GitHub repo for this project locally
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/utshab-roy/larablog.git
    ```
2. cd into your project
    ```sh
    cd larablog
    ```
3. Create a copy of your .env file
    ```sh
    cp .env.example .env
    ```
    This will create a copy of the .env.example file in your project and name the copy simply .env.

4. Install Composer Dependencies
    ```sh
    composer install
    ```
5. Install NPM Dependencies
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```
    Or you can use
    ```sh
    yarn install
    ```

6. Generate an app encryption key
    ```sh
    php artisan key:generate
    ```
    If you check the .env file again, you will see that it now has a long random string of characters in the `APP_KEY` field. We now have a valid app encryption key.

7. Create an empty database for our application

8. In the .env file, add database information to allow Laravel to connect to the database

    In the .env file fill in the `DB_HOST`, `DB_PORT`, `DB_DATABASE`, `DB_USERNAME`, and `DB_PASSWORD` options to match the credentials of the database you just created. This will allow us to run migrations and seed the database in the next step. 
    In order to use the mail smtp protocol for the test, change the `MAIL_HOST`, `MAIL_PORT`, `MAIL_USERNAME`, `MAIL_PASSWORD` credentials according to your setup.


9. Migrate the database
    ```sh
    php artisan migrate
    ```
    Itâ€™s not a bad idea to check your database to make sure everything migrated the way you expected.

10. [Optional]: Seed the database
    ```sh
    php artisan db:seed
    ```
This will create `10` users, `50` posts and `10` categories. The default password for the users is `121212`

**Now you are ready to use the Application**
